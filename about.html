      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hello There! <br> My Name is Rochelle Sol Sohne!</p>
      <p>I am a 19 year-old landscape and portrait photographer raised in Dallas, Texas, born in Suwon, South Korea. My passion has been, and hope it can continue to be, capturing as many precious moments in life I can. I am interested in people, human rights, culture, nature, music, film, food, art, languages, and much much more. </p>
      <p>I am currently a student at The University of Texas at Austin majoring in International Relations and Global Studies, minoring in Asian Studies, and am presently based in Austin, Texas. God is personally a huge part of my life and I am completely free in sharing anything and everything to and with any of my clients. I want to be able to connect and really understand what my client wants and would love to be a continuous and reliable photographer you can trust. :-) </p>
      <p>I am open to a range of fields, whether it be graduation pictures, senior pictures, weddings, advertising, campaigning, landscapes, portraits, or any collaborations.</p>
      <p>I am a college student, thus my summer schedule may vary throughout the years. This summer I will be in South Korea for the full month of June. I will try my best to make both our schedules work to the best!</p>
      <p>*For pricing please contact me and I will be willing to negotiate!</p>
